\title{Draw 3D arrows}
\usage{
arrows3d(coords, headlength = 0.035, head = "end", scale = NULL,
  radius = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{A 2n x 3 matrix giving the start and end (x,y,z) coordinates of n arrows, in pairs.  The first vector
in each pair is taken as the starting coordinates of the arrow, the second as the end coordinates.}

\item{headlength}{Length of the arrow heads, in device units}

\item{head}{Position of the arrow head. Only "end" is presently implemented.}

\item{scale}{scale factor for base and tip of arrow head}

\item{radius}{radius of the base of the arrow head}

\item{...}{rgl arguments passed down to \code{\link[rgl]{segments3d}} and \code{cone3d}}
}
\value{
none
}
\description{
Draws nice 3D arrows with \code{cone3d}s at their tips.
}
\details{
This function is meant to be analogous to \code{\link[graphics]{arrows}}, but for 3D plots using \code{\link[rgl]{rgl}}.
\code{headlength}, \code{scale} and \code{radius} set the length, scale factor and base radius of the arrow head, a
3D cone. The units of these are all in terms of the ranges of the current rgl 3D scene.
