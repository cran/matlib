\title{Show Matrices (A, b) as Linear Equations}
\usage{
showEqn(A, b, vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{either the matrix of coefficients of a system of linear equations, or the matrix \code{cbind(A,b)}}

\item{b}{if supplied, the vector of constants on the right hand side of the equations}

\item{vars}{a numeric or character vector of names of the variables.
If supplied, the length must be equal to the number of unknowns in the equations.
The default is \code{paste0("x", 1:ncol(A)}.}
}
\value{
a character matrix, one row for each equation
}
\description{
Shows what matrices \eqn{A, b} look like as the system of linear equations, \eqn{A x = b}, but written out
as a set of equations.
}
\examples{
  A <- matrix(c(2, 1, -1,
               -3, -1, 2,
               -2,  1, 2), 3, 3, byrow=TRUE)
  b <- c(8, -11, -3)
  showEqn(A, b)
  x <- solve(A, b)
  showEqn(A, b, vars=x)
